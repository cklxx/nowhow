      "summary": "This research investigates using adversarial attacks to reprogram Neural Cellular Automata (Neural CA)—dynamic, self-organizing systems—to display novel, unintended behaviors. It demonstrates how adversarial techniques can manipulate these models beyond their original design, revealing both their adaptability and susceptibility to external interference.",
