      "summary": "This content offers an explanatory deep dive into the core building blocks and design choices of graph neural networks (GNNs), with a specific focus on graph convolutions as a fundamental component. Published on Distill.pub, a platform renowned for intuitive machine learning explanations, it aims to demystify how convolutions adapt to non-Euclidean graph structures.",

        "Graph convolutions are identified as the foundational building blocks of graph neural networks (GNNs), enabling processing of non-Euclidean data.",
        "Critical design choices in GNNs—such as adjacency matrix handling, aggregation functions, and feature transformation—are analyzed for their impact on architecture and performance.",
        "Essential components of graph-based deep learning (e.g., node features, edge information, graph topology) are broken down to clarify their roles in GNN operations.",
        "Intuitive explanations contrast graph convolutions with traditional grid-based convolutions, highlighting adaptations for irregular graph structures."
