  "title": "Autonomous Control Leveraging LLMs: An Agentic Framework for Next-Generation Industrial Automation",
  "content": "arXiv:2507.07115v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The increasing complexity of modern chemical processes, coupled with workforce shortages and intricate fault scenarios, demands novel automation paradigms that blend symbolic reasoning with adaptive control. In this work, we introduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control within a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as interpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes recovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each transition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans. In Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25 states, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path success within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy and latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs on a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target average temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to classical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance, while ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling nonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following lapses and coarse ODE approximations. Our results demonstrate that, with structured feedback and modular agents, LLMs can unify high-level symbolic planningand low-level continuous control, paving the way towards resilient, language-driven automation in chemical engineering.",
