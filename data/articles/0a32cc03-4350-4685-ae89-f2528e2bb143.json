  "content": "arXiv:2507.07203v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models enable dynamic game interactions but struggle with rule-governed trading systems. Current implementations suffer from rule violations, such as item hallucinations and calculation errors, that erode player trust. Here, State-Inference-Based Prompting (SIBP) enables reliable trading through autonomous dialogue state inference and context-specific rule adherence. The approach decomposes trading into six states within a unified prompt framework, implementing context-aware item referencing and placeholder-based price calculations. Evaluation across 100 trading dialogues demonstrates >97% state compliance, >95% referencing accuracy, and 99.7% calculation precision. SIBP maintains computational efficiency while outperforming baseline approaches, establishing a practical foundation for trustworthy NPC interactions in commercial games.",
